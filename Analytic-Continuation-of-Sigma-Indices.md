# Analytic Continuation of the Sigma function across its indices

## Introduction:

The "Sigma" function in mathematics is a notation that is used as an analogue to the iterative operation of addition.
It is a fundamental construct of arithmatic mathematics, and has been studied extensively, however, only for summations to some $`N:N\in\mathbb{Z}`$.
In this text I will be deriving the following expression for the Sigma function:
$$S(x)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=a}^x\left[f(k)-f(k+N)\right]=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=a}^N\left[f(k)-f(k+x)\right]\quad\forall\ x:x\in\mathbb{R}$$
and I will also present cases where
$$S(x):=\sum_{k=a}^x\left[f(k)\right]$$

## Motivation:

In our ever bourgeoning world of experience, we must be aware of the unending arms race associated with the war of discovery, and our in our prized armory that is Mathematics, the blades that must be perpetually be sharpened -- and every idea is a whetstone. Simply put, this is my attempt refurbishing/sharpening one of our oldest knives (the Sigma function). To narrow it down to direction applications, I will be using this result to generalise the Polygamma function (in a future post), and in a similar vain, these ideas crossover with statistical and quantum mechanics.



$$\sum_{k=a}^N \left[ f(k, x) \right] = \sum_{k=a}^N \left[ f(k, x) \right]$$

$\sum_{k=a} ^{N} a_i x^i$

$`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2`$
