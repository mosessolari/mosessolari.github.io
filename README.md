My name is Moses Solari (you may know me by one of my artist soubriquets, like MoSi BILLIONAIRE), and I am a mathematician.
For some context, I started independently studying mathematics around 2012 (after I graduated from highschool) while studying philosophy at university. 
At around the 2 year mark, I decided to transfer from an art degree to a science degree, and in 2019 I was awarded a BSc in applied mathematics and physics from Griffith University (Australia).
Since then I have independently continued my studies and also involved myself in various artistic pursuits.
This blog serves as a space to compile my ideas relating to mathematics and science, while simultaneously being a platform to interact with the greater STEM community (collaboration is power).
